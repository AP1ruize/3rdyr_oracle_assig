This project adopts a hybrid model of C/S mode and B/S mode. The library administrator uses a graphical interface program based on Java Swing, and the reader uses a Web client (developed using JSP) to obtain services. The Web server is Tomcat, and the database is Oracle 11g.

Overall Design
1) Database design
7 database tables were established, including user information table, book information table, inventory table, borrowing table, reservation table, announcement table, and favorites table.
The id in the book and reader information tables is the primary key of each table. The attributes of these two IDs used in other tables are foreign keys.
The specific information will be described in the detailed design. The E-R diagram is as follows:

Detailed Design
1) Database design
In the database design, many advanced functions of the database were in use. In addition to setting the added table in the user table space, primary key and foreign key constraints,
views are also used to simplify book queries (requiring data from two tables), and used blob storage The picture of the book (optional) uses triggers and sequences to realize the self-increment
of the id. These functions facilitate the implementation of business logic.
**User information table**

This table also adds triggers for auto-increment, which will be mentioned later when describing triggers and sequences.

alter table favorite add constraint fk_favorite_bookid

Triggers & Sequences
Oracle does not have the primary key auto-increment feature like MySQL. In order to easily obtain new books and user IDs, 
sequences and triggers are used to implement the primary key auto-increment function.

Statements that create sequences:
CREATE SEQUENCE USERID_SEQUENCE
    INCREMENT BY 1
    START WITH 1
    NOMAXVALUE
NOCACHE;
CREATE SEQUENCE BOOKID_SEQUENCE
    INCREMENT BY 1
    START WITH 1
    NOMAXVALUE
    NOCACHE;
Statements that create triggers:
CREATE TRIGGER USERID_AUTOINCREASE
    BEFORE INSERT ON USERINFO
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
    SELECT USERID_SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.USERID FROM DUAL;
    END;
/
CREATE TRIGGER BOOKID_AUTOINCREASE
    BEFORE INSERT ON BOOKINFO
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
    SELECT BOOKID_SEQUENCE.NEXTVAL INTO :NEW.BOOKID FROM DUAL;
    END;
/

Views
When searching for books, the contents of two tables (book information table + inventory table) need to be displayed. 
In order to facilitate book searching, views are used to simplify the search statements.
Statements that create a view:
create view booksearch as
select bi.bookid bookid, bi.bookname bookname, bi.press press, bi.author author, bi.type type, bi.pic pic, st.amount amount,st.remain remain
from bookinfo bi left join stock st on bi.bookid=st.bookid
/

query： select * from booksearch where (filters)
